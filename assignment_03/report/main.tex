\section{The company is considering to halven[sic] the number of tours between 10 and
14. For this, they would need 250 workers for this shift. Run the resulting
optimization problem and report the change in labor costs. Explain your
result!}
\section{Try running problem (1) with the default large-scale algorithm (a so-called
interior-point method) instead of the algorithm of simplex type which is
used by setting options as in (1). Compare with the
result you obtained in (1). Can you think of any reason for the difference?}
